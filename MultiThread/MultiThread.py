#The multithreading library is lightweight, shares memory, responsible for responsive UI and is used well for I/O bound applications. However, the module isnâ€™t killable and is subject to the GIL

#Threading library in Python

#Multiple threads live in the same process in the same space, each thread will do a specific task, have its own code, own stack memory, instruction pointer, and share heap memory. If a thread has a memory leak it can damage the other threads and parent process
